---My Enhanced Plan---

Role:
You are an expert Python developer specializing in GUI applications with ttkbootstrap and Excel file handling.

Task:
Create a Python GUI application that allows the user to enter digit-based time values, automatically converts them into HH:MM format, and saves the data into an Excel file with a predefined structure.

ðŸ”¹ Requirements
GUI Design

Date Field

An entry widget where the user can select or type a date.

The chosen date persists until manually changed (does not reset on new submissions).

ID Number Field

Entry widget for entering an ID number.

Step Inputs (1â€“7)

Each step includes:

An entry widget for digit input (e.g., 634).

A checkbox for AM/PM (default = AM).

After entering a digit, the app should show the converted time (HH:MM) for verification.

Buttons

Submit: Saves the batch (Date, ID, Step 1â€“7) into the Excel file, appending at the last available row.

Load: Loads an existing Excel file. New entries will append at the end.

Create: Creates a new Excel file with the required structure if none exists.

Excel Design

File format: .xlsx

Columns:

A: Date

B: ID number

Câ€“I: Step 1 â†’ Step 7

Conversion Rules

Input digits must be padded and formatted into HH:MM.

Examples:

62 â†’ 06:02

634 â†’ 06:34

101 â†’ 10:01

1021 â†’ 10:21

AM/PM selection determines the correct 12/24-hour format.

Handle invalid inputs (non-digits) gracefully with error messages.

ðŸ”¹ Output Expectations

Provide clean, optimized, and well-documented Python code. write it in .txt file (create)

Use ttkbootstrap for GUI styling.

Use pandas or openpyxl for Excel operations.

Include comments explaining key parts of the code.

Ensure the application is modular and easy to extend.

---My first Plan---

Goal: Create a GUI application in ttkbootstrap python that convert the digit submitted by the user in TIME FORMAT and saved it to excel with a specified FORMAT
Example: User type [62,634,101,1021,121,1216] then convert it into [06:02,06:34,10:01,10:21,12:01,12:16]

-GUI Format and Widgets:
    -Date: Can be set in any date, does not reset when submitting another batch of details, stay on the date that the user selected unless changed. entry widget for Date
    -ID number: entry widget for ID Number
    -Step 1: entry widget for time - whith check box for AM or PM, make AM is checked by default - then show the converted time to verify by the user
    -Step 2: entry widget for time - whith check box for AM or PM, make AM is checked by default - then show the converted time to verify by the user
    -Step 3: entry widget for time - whith check box for AM or PM, make AM is checked by default - then show the converted time to verify by the user
    -Step 4: entry widget for time - whith check box for AM or PM, make AM is checked by default - then show the converted time to verify by the user
    -Step 5: entry widget for time - whith check box for AM or PM, make AM is checked by default - then show the converted time to verify by the user
    -Step 6: entry widget for time - whith check box for AM or PM, make AM is checked by default - then show the converted time to verify by the user
    -Step 7: entry widget for time - whith check box for AM or PM, make AM is checked by default - then show the converted time to verify by the user

    -Submit button : saved the batch entered by the user in the loaded or created excel file, alway append at the last row available of the excel file
    -Load button : Load excel file, then the neew batch of data saved will be append at the last row available of the excel file
    -Create button : Created Excel File

-Excel Format:
    Column A to Column I = Date, ID number, Step 1, Step 2, Step 3, Step 4, Step 5, Step 6, Step 7
